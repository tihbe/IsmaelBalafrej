The answer is, of course, it depends. Although, I think the usual assumption is incorrect when using leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons. Here's why !\"\ndate: \"3/19/2023\"\ncategories:\n  - SNN\n  - LIF\n---\n\n# Context\n\nI recently came across [a tweet](https://twitter.com/neuralreckoning/status/1580161403415330816) by Dan Goodman, which presented a brief experiment demonstrating the detrimental effects of using a large timestep ($\\delta t$) during the simulation of a LIF neuron. The output spiking rate of a LIF neuron with a Poisson spike input was found to decrease as the timestep increased, with failure observed at soon as $\\delta t=1$ ms - a standard timestep size within the CS-oriented community. \n\nOf course, there is a direct relationship between the choice of $\\delta t$, and real-world simulation duration (or wall-clock time). Ideally, we would all be using a very large $\\delta t$ for our simulation. As [Guillaume Bellec](https://twitter.com/BellecGuill/status/1580440789217595394) pointed out, there might not even be any advantage in a machine learning setting to using a small $\\delta t$.\n\nRather than accepting the necessity of a small timestep, it is worth investigating why the simulation fails, even when employing an exact solver instead of Euler's method. Specifically, there should only be a small distinction when the spike arrives at the beginning, or the end, of a clock cycle. We somewhat over or underestimate the membrane potential by $w\\exp(\\frac{-\\delta t}{\\tau})$ depending on when the spike arrived during the clock period.\n\n# Recreating the Simulation\n\nA straightforward experiment can be devised to replicate the behavior outlined in the tweet. We will simulate 100 LIF neurons, being stimulated by 100 Poisson spike trains sampled at 5 Hz for 4 seconds. The LIF's time constant is $\\tau=10$ ms. The weights between the 100 inputs and 100 output neurons are randomly sampled from a normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0.1, 0.25)$. We then compute the mean output firing rate of every output neuron, and the corresponding standard deviation as error bars.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Configuration\nnp.random.seed(0x1B)\nduration = 4 # seconds\ntau = 0.010\nthresh = 1\nnb_inputs = 100\nnb_outputs = 1000\ninput_rate = 5 #Hz\nweights = np.random.randn(nb_outputs, nb_inputs)*0.5+0.1\ndts = np.logspace(-5, -1.5, 10) # in seconds\n\n# Simulation\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 4), tight_layout=True)\nspike_rates = np.zeros((len(dts), nb_outputs)) # output\nfor i, dt in enumerate(dts):\n    time = np.arange(0, duration, dt)\n    u = np.zeros(nb_outputs)\n    _exp = np.exp(-dt/tau)\n    input_spikes = np.random.poisson(lam=input_rate*dt, size=(len(time), nb_inputs))\n    weighted_input_spikes = input_spikes @ weights.T\n    spike_count = 0\n\n    for j, t in enumerate(time):\n        u = _exp * u + weighted_input_spikes[j]\n        spikes = u > thresh\n        spike_count += spikes\n        u[spikes] = 0 # reset\n    spike_rates[i] += spike_count / duration\nax.errorbar(dts*1000, spike_rates.mean(axis=1), yerr=spike_rates.std(axis=1), capsize=5,)\nax.set_xscale(\"log\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"$\\\\delta t$ [ms]\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Output firing rate [sp/s]\");\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-2-output-1.png){width=566 height=374}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe arrive at a similar-looking plot, where the output spiking frequency is going down near $\\delta t=1$ ms.\n\n# Hypothesis\n\nNumerous commenters in the original thread suggested that $\\delta t$ should be chosen in alignment with $\\tau$. Of course, there is some influence of the chosen time constant $\\tau$, as the smaller the leakage during a timestep, the smaller the error of membrane potential that can happen. However, I am skeptical of this notion due to the stochastic nature of Poisson spikes. Given that a spike can occur at any time during a timestep, it seems likely that the overestimation of membrane potential will roughly cancel out the underestimation. My hypothesis differs from this perspective. I contend that the crucial difference lies elsewhere. Specifically, owing to the nature of the simulation, a neuron can only emit a single spike within a given timestep. Consequently, the LIF neuron enters a sort of implicit refractory period for the duration of the timestep. When the timestep is exceedingly large - greater than 1 ms in this instance - the neuron experiences a prolonged refractory period, leading to the potential loss of critical input spikes as it is unable to integrate new input during this interval.\n\nIf the assumption is correct, i.e the timestep $\\delta t$ if forcing an implicit refractory period, then having a large refractory period but with a smaller $\\delta t$ should yield the same result as having a larger $\\delta t$. If we add a refractory period to the experiment above, we'll see that they do indeed provide a similar effect:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 4), tight_layout=True)\n\nfor refractory_period in [0.001, 0.01, 0.1]:\n    spike_rates = np.zeros((len(dts), nb_outputs)) # output\n    for i, dt in enumerate(dts):\n        time = np.arange(0, duration, dt)\n        refrac_clk = int(refractory_period/dt)\n        u = np.zeros(nb_outputs)\n        refrac_cntr = np.zeros(nb_outputs, dtype=int)\n        _exp = np.exp(-dt/tau)\n        input_spikes = np.random.poisson(lam=input_rate*dt, size=(len(time), nb_inputs))\n        weighted_input_spikes = input_spikes @ weights.T\n        spike_count = 0\n\n        for j, t in enumerate(time):\n            non_refrac_neurons = refrac_cntr==0\n            u[non_refrac_neurons] = _exp * u[non_refrac_neurons] + weighted_input_spikes[j, non_refrac_neurons]\n            spikes = u > thresh\n            spike_count += spikes\n            u[spikes] = 0 # reset\n\n            # Setup refractory period\n            refrac_cntr = np.maximum(refrac_cntr-1, 0)\n            refrac_cntr[spikes] += refrac_clk\n\n        spike_rates[i] += spike_count / duration\n\n\n    ax.errorbar(dts*1000, spike_rates.mean(axis=1), yerr=spike_rates.std(axis=1), capsize=5, label=f\"Refrac.: {1000*refractory_period:0.1f}ms\")\n    ax.set_xscale(\"log\")\n    ax.set_xlabel(\"$\\\\delta t$ [ms]\")\n    ax.set_ylabel(\"Output firing rate [sp/s]\")\n    ax.legend(loc=\"lower left\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-3-output-1.png){width=566 height=374}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs we see, the output firing rates align when $\\delta t$ is equal to the refractory period. For example, at $\\delta t=10$ ms, the orange line only starts going down when the timestep becomes bigger than the explicit refractory period. Therefore, the model is actually correct. The only difference is that we have to consider that the effective refractory period is equal to the maximum between $\\delta t$ and the explicit refractory period. \n\n# Solution\n\nThe solution to this problem is quite simple. As I said before, the timestep of the simulation forces an implicit refractory period because the neuron can only spike once per timstep. If we remove this limitation, then we should remove this implicit refractory period and the output firing rate should be constant regardless of the timestep.\n\nTo do so, we count the number of times the membrane potential $u(t)$ is above the threshold to estimate how many times the neuron would spike in one timestep. $n_{spikes}(t)=\\lfloor \\frac{\\max \\{u(t), 0\\}}{u_{thresh}} \\rfloor$. We also edit the reset, such that we remove the threshold from the membrane potential $n_{spikes}$ times, referred to as a soft-reset. This reset mechanism is more precise when dealing with large timesteps, as the accumulated membrane potential is not wasted by an early spike during a timestep. We re-simulate the first experiment with this modification, and we obtain:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nnp.random.seed(0x1B)\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 4), tight_layout=True)\nspike_rates = np.zeros((len(dts), nb_outputs)) # output\nfor i, dt in enumerate(dts):\n    time = np.arange(0, duration, dt)\n    u = np.zeros(nb_outputs)\n    _exp = np.exp(-dt/tau)\n    input_spikes = np.random.poisson(lam=input_rate*dt, size=(len(time), nb_inputs))\n    weighted_input_spikes = input_spikes @ weights.T\n    spike_count = 0\n\n    for j, t in enumerate(time):\n        u = _exp * u + weighted_input_spikes[j]\n        #previous code: spikes = u > thresh\n        spikes = np.floor(np.maximum(u, 0) / thresh) # multiple spikes\n        spike_count += spikes\n        u -= spikes*thresh\n        #u[spikes > 0] = 0 \n\n    spike_rates[i] += spike_count / duration\nax.errorbar(dts*1000, spike_rates.mean(axis=1), yerr=spike_rates.std(axis=1), capsize=5,)\nax.set_xscale(\"log\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"$\\\\delta t$ [ms]\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Output firing rate [sp/s]\");\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-4-output-1.png){width=566 height=374}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd voil√†! We get the expected firing rate across all the timesteps. While this solution is very interesting for computational neuroscientists, it partly removes the energy friendliness of spiking neural networks since they are not binary anymore, and the reset involves some arithmetic.\n\n",
