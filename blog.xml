  <title>Are electric cars a worse investment ?</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ Electric vehicles (EVs) are generaly more expensive than their gasoline counterpart. Yet, adoption has still be relatively high thanks to governement incentives and the cheap cost of electricity in the province of Quebec. But, as the <a href="https://www.quebec.ca/transports/transport-electrique/aide-financiere-vehicule-electrique/services-en-ligne-roulez-vert">Roulez Vert</a> program from the government of Quebec is slowly getting phased out, it is worth examining more precicely the financial impact of EVs. The programâ€™s initial goal was to promote EVs with monetary incentives (up to $7,000 CAD for new cars and $3,500 CAD for used cars). Removing this program means that every EV purchased starting on January 1, 2025, will be more expensive. ]]></description>

  <title>What if you could grow an AI chip ? ðŸ§ </title>

  <description><![CDATA[ GPUs are not very efficient for machine learning, but they are dominant in the market because custom chips - with their respective AI models - are expensive to design and manufacture. Imagine if we could grow AI devices using data. ]]></description>

  <title>Selection of a timestep for SNN simulation</title>
  <dc:creator>Ismael Balafrej</dc:creator>
  <link>https://ibalafrej.com/posts/2023-03-18-dt-vs-lif/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ I recently came across <a href="https://twitter.com/neuralreckoning/status/1580161403415330816">a tweet</a> by Dan Goodman, which presented a brief experiment demonstrating the detrimental effects of using a large timestep (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta%20t">) during the simulation of a LIF neuron. The output spiking rate of a LIF neuron with a Poisson spike input was found to decrease as the timestep increased, with failure observed at soon as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta%20t=1"> ms - a standard timestep size within the CS-oriented community. ]]></description>
